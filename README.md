# Where-Souuls-Go-Sandbox
 A little project I'm open-sourcing to anyone who wants to help make it better, or even just anyone who wants to look under the hood. :)

Updates! :
   - Placing blocks is now a thing
   - Toolbar has been added
   - Skeletons now collide with blue brick blocks
   - Some performance optimisations have been done
